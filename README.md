## Problem Statement
### Apartment Building Administrator
Jane is the administrator of an apartment building and she wants to manage the monthly expenses for each apartment. Each expense is stored using the following elements: `apartment` (*number of apartment, positive integer*), `amount` (*positive integer*), `type` (*from one of the predefined categories `water`, `heating`, `electricity`, `gas` and `other`*). Write a program that implements the functionalities exemplified below:

**(A) Add new transaction**
`add <apartment> <type> <amount>`\
e.g.\
`add 25 gas 100` â€“ add to apartment 25 an expense for `gas` in amount of `100 RON`

**(B) Modify expenses**\
`remove <apartment>`\
`remove <start apartment> to <end apartment>`\
`remove <type>`\
`replace <apartment> <type> with <amount>`\
e.g.\
`remove 15` â€“ remove all expenses for apartment 15\
`remove 5 to 10` â€“ remove all expenses for apartments between 5 and 10\
`remove gas` â€“ remove all `gas` expenses from all apartments\
`replace 12 gas with 200` â€“ replace the amount of the expense with type `gas` for apartment 12 with `200 RON`
 
**(C)	Display expenses having different properties**\
`list`\
`list <apartment>`\
`list [ < | = | > ] <amount>`\
e.g.\
`list` â€“ display all expenses\
`list 15` â€“ display all expenses for apartment 15\
`list > 100` - display all apartments having total expenses `>100 RON`\
`list = 17` - display all apartments having total expenses `=17 RON`
